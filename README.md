### Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx)

# What is WZDx Specification?
The Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification seeks to define a universal langauge to enable a critical mass of infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) to collaboratively and voluntarily make harmonized work zone data available for third party use. This project is part of a larger effort by USDOT to develop a common framework to facilitate mutually beneficial voluntary data exhanges to support and accelerate the safe, efficient, and accessible integration of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) into the transportation system.


## WZDx Implementation Road Map
Up-to-date information about dynamic conditions occurring on roads – such as construction events – can help AVs navigate safely and efficiently. Many IOOs maintain data on work zone activity. However, a lack of common data standards and convening mechanisms makes it difficult and costly for third parties – including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and navigation applications – to access and use these data across various jurisdictions. 

In support of AV integration into our nation’s transportation system, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and USDOT’s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) are co-leading the WZDx project. The effort seeks to jumpstart the voluntary adoption of a basic work zone data specification through collaboration with data producers and data users. WZDx will enable collaborative maintenance and expansion of the specification as operational and technological enhancements become available.

The department's implementation plan is two-fold:
1. **Support IOOs to stand up feeds using the common core:** Upon finalization of the first iteration of work zone data specification, data producers will utilize the specification to make their respective active work zone data feeds available for use by non-government users.
2.  **Support original equipmemt manufacturers (OEMs) & navigation application parties incorporate data:** These users will then use the harmonized data in a meaningful way. These two outcomes will result in the establishment of the voluntary date exchange of work zone data (i.e., a minimum viable product (MVP) of harmonized work zone data). 
This approach is intended to be repeatably leading to the accelerated harmonization of local data.

The following **data producers** and **data users** (i.e., the WZDx Working Group) voluntarily committed to participating and have been actively involved in the development of the standardized data specification:

## How do can I participate?
The first phase of this project is focused on specification implementation and therefore steps to collaborate are geared more towards IOOs. Support for other data producers and the third party data users will continue to develop in the subsequent phases of this effort.
