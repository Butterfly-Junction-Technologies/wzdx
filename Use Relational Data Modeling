What:  Use Relational Data Modeling Techniques to design the content of the Work Zone Data Specification.

Why:  Version 1 of the Work Zone Data Specification relies on data dictionary, markup, and exchange languages (TMDD, XML, JSON) to define its content.  It does not employ well established data design methods.  

Using Relational Data Modeling Techniques to design the Work Zone Data Specification will;
•	Organize the data more efficiently
•	Increase consistency
•	Ease data retrieval
•	Enable a flexible and scalable data model
•	Promote Standards-Centric development of applications

Using Relational Data Modeling Techniques to design the Work Zone Data Specification will not;
•	Change the specifications content
•	Prohibit publishing content according to the TMDD
•	Prohibit publishing content according to version 1 of the specification
