## **Data Tables**
**Revised September 15, 2018**.

This document explains the types of files and the data elements, data frames and enumerated types that make up a Work Zone data feed. The Common Core Data Table (Table 1), and subsequent tables in this document, include the following columns:
- *Data Name* - name of the data concept (either a data element or data frame) 
- *Data Type* - identification of the data concept as a data element or data frame and whether it is an enumerated type
- *Data Description* - description of the data concept
- *Conformance* - description of the requirement for including data in the data feed file. There are three categories of conformance:
    - Required - must be included
    - Optional - may be included
    - Conditional - associated with two or more data concepts; requires that at least one of the concepts be included in the data feed file
- *Notes* - comments, guidance, or notes for future consideration
