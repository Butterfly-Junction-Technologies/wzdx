# WZDx Specification Content
The WZDx specification uses a relational model to manage data structure. It defines distinct entities (called tables or objects) which contain the data content (called fields or properties) of each entity. The relationship between these entities describes how the data within each is related and how the feed should be built. These entities are found in the [data-tables](/spec-content/data-tables) directory.

Some fields within a data table are restricted to a defined enumeration of values. These enumerations are found in the [enumerated-types](/spec-content/enumerated-types) directory.

## Data Tables
The WZDx specification data content is organized into distinct entities which are represented by tables. Each table is described by its own file in the [data-tables](/spec-content/data-tables) directory and represents a distinct entity, such as a road event, a lane, or the information about a feed. All pieces of data that describe that entity are included within the table. Tables are related using a foreign key, which is an ID field that points to the primary ID field (primary key) of a different table. This relational structure indicates how to store data as well as how the feed output should be built from tables.

The relationships between tables is shown visually using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

### Entity Relationship Diagram
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) below indicates the relationship between the data tables.

### Data Table Structure
Each data table defines a list of data fields which are described by the following characteristics:

- **Field Name** - name of the field or column
- **Data Type** - identifies the kind of data being stored and indicates if the fieldâ€™s content is restricted to an enumeration
- **Description** - description of the data content
- **Conformance** - description of the requirement for including data in the data feed file. There are three categories of conformance:
    - *Required* - must be included
    - *Optional* - may be included
    - *Conditional* - associated with two or more data concepts; requires that at least one of the concepts be included in the data feed file
- **Notes** - comments, guidance, or notes for future consideration

### List of Data Tables
This section provides a list of all data tables uses in the WZDx specification.

- [Lanes](/spec-content/data-tables/lanes.md)
- [Lane Restrictions](/spec-content/data-tables/lane_restrictions.md)
- [Relationships](/spec-content/data-tables/relationships.md)
- [Road Events](/spec-content/data-tables/road_events.md)
- [Road Event Data Sources](/spec-content/data-tables/road_event_data_sources.md)
- [Road Event Feed Info](/spec-content/data-tables/road_event_feed_info.md)
- [Types of Work](/spec-content/data-tables/types_of_work.md)


## Enumerated Types
Some fields within a data table are restricted to a distinct enumeration of values, defined by an enumerated type. The enumerations for each enumerated type as well as what data fields it is used in is described in its own file in the [enumerated-types](/spec-content/enumerated-types) directory.

Some enumerated types are specifically derived from the Traffic Management Data Dictionary (TMDD); these are found in the [enumerated-types/derived-from-its-standards](/spec-content/enumerated-types/derived-from-its-standards/) directory.

### Enumerated Types Derived from ITS Standards
The following enumerated types used in the WZDx spec are translated from enumerations from the [TMDD](https://www.standards.its.dot.gov/Content/documents/advisories/TMDD_2013.aspx):

- [direction](/spec-content/enumerated-types/derived-from-its-standards/direction.md)
- [lane_type](/spec-content/enumerated-types/derived-from-its-standards/lane_type.md)


Example of data frame in the TMDD (specified in ASN.1 format)
```xml
DATA-TYPE "EventLane ::= SEQUENCE {
    lanes-type ITIS.LaneRoadway OPTIONAL,
    link-direction Link-direction OPTIONAL,
    lanes-total-original Link-lanes-count OPTIONAL,
    lanes-total-affected Link-lanes-count OPTIONAL,
    event-lanes-affected SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..64)) OF Link-lane-number OPTIONAL,
    lanes-status ITIS.Closures OPTIONAL,
    ...  }"
```
